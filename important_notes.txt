in this project the platform used for payment is "Stripe"

but stripe is not available (banned) in Pakistan but you can use it by another "legal way"

to use stripe account legally you have to open your company in UK or other country that supports "Stripe"

your payment account, sim, and othr related things must from UK (bank, sim, etc)

then you can make your account and get your "STRIPE_CLIENT_KEY" and "STRIPE_SERVER_KEY"

after getting a stripe account you can follow this repo

this payment integration requires

"STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" and "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
